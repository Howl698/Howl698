After years in executive leadership and quality assurance roles, I aspired to become a data analyst. 

Like connecting puzzle pieces, I enjoy the process of discovery that comes with working with data and putting the pieces together to paint an insightful picture. 

I am proficient in using tools including SQL, Python, Tableau,  and Excel to derive, clean, analyze, and communicate data from a variety of sources.

I seek to engage in critical processes that facilitate data-driven business decisions in support of the mission, strategic initiatives and/or contractual obligations of your organization, leveraging my evaluation and data analysis skills. 

My roles have frequently required me to organize and analyze diverse arrays of data from multiple sources, resulting in opportunities to enhance service delivery for vulnerable populations, minimize compliance risk to funding and contractual obligations, inform budget decisions, and market services to potential partners and customers.  

I have extensive experience in successfully establishing and managing projects, outcomes, budgets, and operations.  Further, I have collaborated with a variety of stakeholders including business and technical teams, business partners, boards, executive leadership, advocacy groups, consultants and regulatory entities.
